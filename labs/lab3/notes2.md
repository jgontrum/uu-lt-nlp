## 5 - Explore different test sets

Expectations:

- Other Sherlock Holmes stories: Performs very good, similar vocabulary and writing style of the author.

- Story from the same author. Worse then the first one, but still ok. Contains the same wiriting style, but also more OOV words.

- Other stories from the same time. Worse then the first two ones. More OOV and a higher perplexity, since combinations of bigrams are used differently.

- Same file: Perfect results
